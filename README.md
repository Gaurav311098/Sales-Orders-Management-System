# Sales & Orders Management System (MySQL)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **relational database** to manage sales operations, including customers, orders, products, and payments. It provides a simulated environment for data analysis and reporting, making it ideal for learning SQL queries and database design best practices.

## Key Features
- **Database Design:** Created a fully **normalized database** using MySQL with properly defined relationships between tables.  
- **Data Population:** Inserted **500+ mock records** to simulate real-world transactions.  
- **Querying & Analysis:** Utilized **JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING clauses, and views** to analyze:  
  - Sales trends by product, month, and category  
  - Customer spending patterns  
  - Payment statuses and trends  
- **Performance & Organization:** Ensured **data integrity** through primary and foreign keys, and optimized queries for reporting.  

## Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tools:** MySQL Workbench  

## Database Schema
The system includes the following tables:  
- **Customers:** Customer details like name, email, and contact information  
- **Products:** Product details including price and category  
- **Orders:** Tracks orders placed by customers  
- **Order_Items:** Details of each product in an order  
- **Payments:** Records payment methods and status  
- **Employees:** Staff information for order management
